This blog is about a very broad topic, but in the process of doing it I have learned a lot about animals, their behaviour and their environment. 

For example, that dolphins can communicate in different ways and that they can also learn from each other, but it also reinforced the idea that we can have a much bigger impact on animals than some people think.
